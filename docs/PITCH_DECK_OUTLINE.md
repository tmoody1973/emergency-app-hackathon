## Slide 2: The Problem 🚨
**Visual**: Split screen showing overwhelmed coordinator vs. stressed person in need

### The Crisis Coordination Bottleneck
- **Current Reality**: Non-profit emergency organizations rely on manual coordination
  - 📧 Email chains that take hours
  - 📞 Phone tag between volunteers
  - 📋 Paper forms during crises
  - ⏰ Response delays that can cost lives

**Key Stat**:
> "Traditional emergency response coordination takes 4-6 hours from need to volunteer dispatch"

**The Impact**:
- Overwhelmed coordinators spend 80% of time on manual matching
- Volunteers waste time on irrelevant requests
- People in need wait in uncertainty during critical moments

### Intelligent Matching Platform with Zero-Touch Automation

**Three Revolutionary Steps**:
1. **🤖 Conversational AI Intake** (30 seconds)
   - "My house is flooding, we need shelter"
   - AI extracts structured data automatically
   - No forms, no friction

2. **🎯 Intelligent Matching** (10 seconds)
   - Location-based scoring
   - Skill alignment
   - Availability checking
   - Historical performance

3. **📲 Instant Dispatch** (20 seconds)
   - Auto-notify best volunteers
   - One-click accept/decline
   - Real-time updates

**Total Time**: < 60 seconds from need to volunteer notification

---

## Slide 4: Live Demo 🎬
**Visual**: Screen recording or live demo

### Watch It Work:
1. **Intake**: Person describes emergency in natural language
2. **Extraction**: AI identifies type, location, urgency, needs
3. **Matching**: System finds top 3 volunteers within 5 miles
4. **Dispatch**: Volunteer receives notification and accepts
5. **Dashboard**: Coordinator sees real-time status update

**Demo Scenario**:
"House flooded in Springfield, family of 4 with children needs emergency shelter"
