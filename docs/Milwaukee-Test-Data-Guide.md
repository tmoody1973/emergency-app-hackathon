## üéØ How to Use This Data

### 1. Load the Data

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
-- Copy/paste the entire seed-milwaukee-data.sql file
-- Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Milwaukee test data loaded successfully!
üìä 10 Businesses, 15 Volunteers, 15 Emergencies
```

### 2. View on the Map

**Navigate to Dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:3002/dashboard
```

You should see:
- Interactive map with 15 colored pins (emergencies)
- Red pins = critical urgency
- Orange pins = high urgency
- Yellow pins = medium urgency
- Blue pins = low urgency

**Click any pin** to see:
- Emergency type and urgency
- Description
- Location address
- Who requested help
- When it was reported
- Current status

### 3. Test the Matching Feature

**Manual Testing via Dashboard:**
1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Click on an emergency
3. Note the emergency ID
4. Use the matching API (see below)

**API Testing:**

Use your API client (Postman, curl, or browser) to test auto-matching:

```bash
# Test auto-match for a critical emergency
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/match \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "emergencyId": "YOUR_EMERGENCY_ID_HERE",
    "action": "auto"
  }'
```

**What should happen:**
- System finds nearby volunteers and businesses
- Calculates distance and match scores
- Creates match records in database
- Returns matched helpers with contact info

### 4. Test Different Scenarios

**Scenario A: Critical Emergency with Children**
- Emergency: "Family of 4 trapped in flood" (2834 N 25th St)
- Should match: Volunteers with childcare skills, businesses with shelter

- Expected matches: South Side Grocers, Northside Family Services

### 5. Verify Geographic Distribution

**Check the map shows good spread:**
- Pins across North, South, East, West sides
- No clustering in one area
- Easy to distinguish individual emergencies
- Zoom in/out works smoothly

### 6. Test Filtering (if implemented)

**Filter by urgency:**
- Critical: Should show 3 red pins
- High: Should show 4 orange pins
- Medium: Should show 5 yellow pins
- Low: Should show 3 blue pins

**Filter by type:**
