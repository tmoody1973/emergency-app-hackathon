# LinkedIn Post - Hackathon Achievement

## Professional Version

I'm excited to share what I built at the Equity in Tech Summit hackathon at Discovery World during Wisconsin Tech Month! üöÄ

### The Problem:

Non-profit organizations face significant challenges when coordinating emergency response efforts. When disasters strike or community members face crises, information comes through scattered channels - phone calls, texts, walk-ins, and social media. Coordinators struggle to:
- Quickly assess the urgency and scope of each situation
- Visualize where help is needed across their service area
- Match available volunteers with specific skills to urgent needs
- Track business resources and community partnerships
- Monitor response progress from initial request through resolution

This fragmented approach leads to slower response times, missed opportunities to help, and difficulty prioritizing the most critical needs.

### My Solution:

Over the course of the event, I developed **RapidResponse** - a full-stack emergency response coordination platform designed to centralize emergency intake, visualize needs geographically, and streamline volunteer and resource matching for non-profit organizations.

### What I Built:

**Core Features:**
- ü§ñ AI-powered emergency intake system using Claude AI that conducts empathetic conversations to gather critical information
- üó∫Ô∏è Interactive real-time map visualization showing emergency locations with urgency-based color coding (critical ‚Üí high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low)
- üë• Volunteer network directory with skills matching and availability tracking
- üè¢ Business resource directory for community partnerships
- üìä Dashboard with filtering and status tracking (open, matched, in progress, resolved)

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL), serverless API routes
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API with structured conversation flows
- **Mapping:** Leaflet + OpenStreetMap with Nominatim geocoding
- **Deployment:** Vercel with continuous deployment

### Key Technical Achievements:

‚úÖ Built geocoding service to automatically convert addresses to map coordinates
‚úÖ Implemented dynamic client-side rendering to handle SSR challenges with mapping libraries
‚úÖ Created AI conversation system with structured data extraction
‚úÖ Designed responsive UI with real-time filtering and search capabilities
‚úÖ Integrated multiple data sources (emergencies, volunteers, businesses) with relational database architecture

### The Impact:

This platform addresses a real need - helping non-profits efficiently coordinate emergency response by:
- Reducing response time through automated intake and matching
- Visualizing geographic distribution of needs and resources
- Connecting skilled volunteers with urgent community needs
- Tracking outcomes from initial request through resolution

Huge thanks to the organizers at Discovery World and all participants at Wisconsin Tech Month for creating such an inspiring environment for innovation and equity in technology!

### Open Source & Live Demo:

I've made this project **open source** so others can learn from it, contribute, or adapt it for their communities.

## Casual/Shorter Version

Had an incredible time at the Equity in Tech Summit hackathon during Wisconsin Tech Month! üéâ

I built **RapidResponse** - an emergency coordination platform that uses AI (Claude) to help non-profits connect people in crisis with volunteers and resources.

**Highlights:**
- ü§ñ AI chat bot for empathetic emergency intake
- üó∫Ô∏è Live map showing emergency locations by urgency
- üë• Volunteer matching based on skills and availability
- üè¢ Business resource directory
- ‚ö° Real-time filtering and status tracking

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, and Leaflet mapping. Deployed live on Vercel.

This was my first time combining AI conversational interfaces with geospatial data visualization, and I learned so much about building for social impact!

**Open source and live!** Check out the code on GitHub: https://github.com/tmoody1973/emergency-app-hackathon

Thanks to Discovery World and the Wisconsin Tech Month team for an amazing event! üôå

## Story Version (More Personal)

This past weekend, I participated in the Equity in Tech Summit hackathon at Discovery World, and I'm proud of what came together in such a short time.

**The Challenge:**
Non-profits often struggle to coordinate emergency response - matching people who need help with available volunteers and resources. Information comes in through scattered channels (calls, texts, walk-ins), and it's hard to see the full picture of needs across a community.

**My Solution - RapidResponse:**
I built a platform that brings everything together:

When someone needs help, they chat with an AI assistant (powered by Claude) that asks the right questions with empathy - understanding their situation, location, urgency, and specific needs like shelter, food, or medical care.

That information automatically appears on a dashboard with an interactive map, so coordinators can instantly see where help is needed most. The system also maintains directories of volunteers (with their skills and availability) and businesses that provide resources.

**What I Learned:**
- Geocoding real addresses and handling edge cases in mapping
- Designing AI conversations that feel natural while extracting structured data
- Building responsive interfaces that work for stressed users in crisis situations
- The importance of privacy and security when handling sensitive emergency data

**The Tech:**
Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, Anthropic Claude API, Leaflet mapping, deployed on Vercel. Full-stack from database design to AI integration to geospatial visualization.

This project reminded me why I love building software - technology can meaningfully improve how communities care for each other.

**The project is open source!** I've shared the full code on GitHub so others can learn, contribute, or adapt it for their own communities: https://github.com/tmoody1973/emergency-app-hackathon

Grateful for the Equity in Tech Summit organizers, Discovery World, and everyone at Wisconsin Tech Month for creating space for innovation with purpose.
